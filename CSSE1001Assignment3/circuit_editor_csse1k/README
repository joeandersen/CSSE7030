CIRCUIT ANALYZER
----------------

The circuit analyzer is contained in this directory within the circuit/ and circuit_gui/
python modules. circuit_editor.py is a launcher for the PyQt GUI circuit editor/analyzer.

The library is documented using python docstrings, for the most part. There is no real
user guide for the GUI, but its operation should be fairly intuitive to somebody
with a little bit of background in electronic circuitry and analysis.

DEPENDENCIES
----------------
For the non-GUI analysis library:
	scipy (specifically, scipy.optimize)
	http://www.scipy.org/

For the PyQt4-based GUI:
	scipy (from analysis library)

	PyQt4 (4.2 or later)
	http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

	py.magic (from the py library)
	http://codespeak.net/py/dist/

Once the dependencies are installed, the circuit_editor.py launcher
should run fine as a script (it has a shebang line at the top), or
else by running "python circuit_editor.py" from the console.
