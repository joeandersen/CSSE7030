The  land of Skyre  was nearing  its end.
Grass was turned to dust,  plants to ash.
People   starved   on   the   streets.
And   all   were   grim.
It    was     all    due   to   Oregan.
<P>For two years she reigned and brought
destruction to Skyre. She used the land
and people as her plaything. 
But that matters little,
for Hope is almost lost among all people.
Oregan's minions were too powerful!
<P>Oregan lived in her playground castle,
the only prospering location left in Skyre.
One could only live in Skyre if one was
a servent in the Queen's castle. The
future was bleak.
<P>However, unbeknownst to all but the
water faieries who took her in, Oregan's
twin sister and master of the Hake And
Trout Magical Doodoo Stick, Mint, was
heading towards the castle now.
<P>MINT: "To the castle! Will be my
castle, and no one's gonna stop me! That
sister of mine, well now is the time, to
pound her with this Stick, k'yme?"
You, please awaken the Stick's powers and 
help Mint get to the castle. Collecting
Hope for the people along the way.
GO, MINT! GO!
