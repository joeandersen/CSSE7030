OREGAN: "I can't believe this. How did
you become so good?
MINT: "By defending justice, fool! Unlike
your wrong, evil, sadistic and smelly ways!
<P>OREGAN: "For now, you may have this castle.
But oh don't you forget. There will be an act
two. I will be back with a stronger, smarter,
faster, sexier, more rockin' army!!!!! But,
'till then, sister, adieu.
<P> Oregan flew off never to be seen in the
first half of the game again. Since there aren't
any more levels, here stands the happy ending.
MINT: ^_^
Mint returned the hope to people and plants and
animals. Slowly, the land began to reform back
into its old slendor.
<P> Until one year later....
<P> THE END!
